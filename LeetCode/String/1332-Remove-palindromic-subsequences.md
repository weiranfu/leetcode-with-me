Given a string `s` consisting only of letters `'a'` and `'b'`. In a single step you can remove one palindromic **subsequence** from `s`.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-palindromic-subsequences/)

<!--more-->

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

#### Tricky 

The key is how to remove subsequences?

Consider that there're only `a` and `b` in the string. If the string is not a palindrome, we need at most two steps to remove all letters.

Firstly remove all `a` letters as palindrome. Secondly remove all `b` letters as palindrome.

#### First solution 

```java
class Solution {
    public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (isPalindrome(s)) return 1;
        return 2;
    }
    private boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int l = 0, r = s.length() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            if (s.charAt(l) != s.charAt(r)) {
                return false;
            }
            l++;
            r--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

T: O(n)			S: O(1)
