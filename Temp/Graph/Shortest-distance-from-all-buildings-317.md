You want to build a house on an *empty* land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values **0**, **1** or **2**, where:

- Each **0** marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
- Each **1** marks a building which you cannot pass through.
- Each **2** marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.

**Example:**

```
Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]

1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 7 

Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
             the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total 
             travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.

#### BFS  

bfs each `1` to find out min distance to each `0`, **accumulate this distances to each 0 location**: distance\[]\[], finally find out min value from distance\[]\[]
- In the case of cannot reach all house: 

  not all `0`s can reach each house: reachCount\[]\[] to count the # of house each 0 can reach, only >= houseCount is valid

- [improve speed]ï¼šduring BFS we could check whether all houses are reachable from each other.

  if count reachable house < houseCount, return `-1` directly!!!
